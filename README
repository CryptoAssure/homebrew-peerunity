This repository contains WyseNynja's UNOFFICIAL brews relating to bitcoin.

These brews can be installed via the raw GitHub URLs, or by cloning this
repository locally with `brew tap WyseNynja/bitcoin`.

After tapping, run `brew prune` so that you don't have to prefix formula with 'WyseNynja/bitcoin/'

And run `brew update` and `brew doctor` often!

= Armory-QT =

Armory is having issues on OS X.  It seems to hang and crash after a few minutes of use.  Mavericks seems even less stable.

= Bitcoind =

This formula currently has trouble on Mavericks.  You will have to install with `--HEAD` until the next bitcoind release (>0.8.5).

= bitcoind-next-test =

This is @luke-jr's branch of things upcoming in the main bitcoind.  It currently does not work on Mavericks.  Stay tuned!

= Libbitcoin / obelisk / sx =

These formulas require GCC 4.8, a newer than the compiler than comes with OS X.  Because of this, building these packages takes a while.  Compiling like this is not supported by the brew developers, but I don't see any other way.

Currently, libbitcoin (and probably obelisk) compile in Mavericks, although both seem to be having some trouble with their libraries.  I'm debugging now and expect to have sx working soon.  Please contribute anything you know to the open issues or open a new one!

= Vanitygen =

I am pretty sure this works, but I don't have a system to test the GPU or pooled mining.
