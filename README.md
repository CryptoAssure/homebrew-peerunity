# Formula

## Armory-QT

Armory is having issues on OS X.  It seems to hang and crash after a few minutes of use.  Mavericks seems even less stable.

## bitcoind

This formula currently has trouble on Mavericks.  You will have to install with `--HEAD` until the next bitcoind release (>0.8.5).

## bitcoind-next-test

This is @luke-jr's branch of things upcoming in the main bitcoind.  It currently does not work on Mavericks.  Stay tuned!

## libbitcoin / Obelisk / sx

These formula require GCC 4.8 which is newer than the compiler that comes with OS X (and comes from `brew tap homebrew/versions`).  Because of this, building these packages takes a while, but they seem to be working! Hard coding other versions of compilers into a formula like this is not supported by the brew developers, but I don't see any other way.

I've yet to actually do much testing yet, so things might still be broken, but the quick things I've played with have worked well.  Please open an issue if you see anything wrong!  And don't use these packages for merchant purposes until they are fully tested.

## Vanitygen

I am pretty sure this works, but I don't have a system to test the GPU or pooled mining.
